Sending email through the smtp server using c++

People all around the world communicate effectively through mail system. It helps us share the text messages, audios, videos and other media files at free of cost.

The SMTP server thereby gets the mail as a string of code from the sender, finds the address to which the mail has to be sent and sends the mail to the corresponding server such as gmail.
